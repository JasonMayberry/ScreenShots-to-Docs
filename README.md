# ScreenShots-to-Docs
This node.js script that can be ran inside a folder to produce a printable document from thousands of screenshots instantly. Mac OS X screenshot file names look like this by default: "Screen Shot 2018-09-08 at 6.38.32 PM.png". doc.js 
will generate and display them in order on the browser. **Mac OS X is the only platform that I have tested it on.
