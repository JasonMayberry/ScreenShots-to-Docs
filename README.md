# ScreenShots-to-Docs
This node.js script that can be ran inside a folder to produce a printable document from thousands of screenshots instantly. 
Mac OS X screenshot file names look like this by default: "Screen Shot 2018-09-08 at 6.38.32 PM.png". doc.js 
will generate and display them in the order they were taken on the browser. 
* Mac OS X is the only platform that I have tested it on but it should work on Windows as well.

# How to test and use doc.js
1. Install node.js if you don't already have it.
2. Download the "ScreenShots-to-Docs-master.zip" file.
3. Unzip it
3. CD to the "ScreenShots" folder in the terminal.
4. Type: node doc.js
5. Then open your browser to http://localhost:3000/
6. Hit Ctrl-p to print or save as a .PDF
7. (optional) Use the WYSIWYG editor: "PageEdit" in Google Chrome to customize the document before you print it.
